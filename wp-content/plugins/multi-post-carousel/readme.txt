This "Multi Post Carousel" plugin displays the category post by just simply passing the category ID and total number of post to be displayed in a slide.

== Description ==
Multi post Carousel is a plugin used to display the posts in the form of carousel, filtered by category ID, using shortcode. No need of any programming skills, some options are set by default but user can also set the options from plugin settings. Carousel can be easily created on any page or post by using shortcode.

<h4>Features: </h4>
1. Displays post on Carousel by category id.
2. Total number of images per slide can only be in multiples of 4 to work plugin properly. Such as 4,8,12 and so on.
3. Easy to add the shortcode.

<h4>Shortcode:</h4>
<pre>[post-slides cat_id="4" totalpost="12"]</pre>
OR
<pre>[post-slides cat_id="4" totalpost="8"]</pre>
OR
<pre>[post-slides cat_id="4" totalpost="4"]</pre>

Here "cat_id" defines category id, "totalpost" defines number of posts per slide. By default "totalpost" is set to 12.
